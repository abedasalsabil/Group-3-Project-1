# Group-3-Project-1

Our research topic analyzes the number of coffee shops across all six districts of Toronto, Ontario, with relation to amenities available within the coffee shops. For analysis, we chose to look at three amenities: wheelchair access, internet access, and takeaway option.

Our research asks two questions:
  - How densely populated is each district of Toronto with coffee shops?
  - Does the number of coffee shops within a district affect the amenities available?
  
From our analysis of the data we retreived through api.geoapify, the folowing conclusions can be made:
  - Compared to all districts, North York has the most coffee shops out of all districts.
  - Considering sq km area, Downtown Toronto is the most densely populated with coffee shops. 
  - With relation to total coffee shops, Downtown Toronto has the most coffee shops with wheelchair access.
  - Across all districts, most coffee shops displayed high takeaway option percentage. 
  - There is no strong relationship between number of coffee shops across district and amenities available. However, it could be inferred that the more populated and developed a region is, the more amenities its coffee shops may have. More research is required to further analyze this.
  - With relation to total coffee shops, Scarborough confirmed the lowest percentage with 'yes' to internet access
  
Limitations of the data:
  - Information of coffee shops per district may have an overlap over neighbouring districts, as geoapify uses radius to find places using the coordinates, and the area of the districts is shown in square kilometres in more square-type shapes. Therefore, the number may not be fully indicative of coffee shops in one district alone or cover all of the coffee shops within a district.
  - There is some data missing within amenities of each coffee shop across districts. This could indicate that the real representation of available amenities for coffee shops may be higher.
  - The reason wheelchair and internet access are on the lower end within in each district could be because of missing data. There was more missing data within these amenities compared to the takeaway option.
